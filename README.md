# DOAS - Deliver on Agile Speed

DOAS is an experiment to visualize software delivery 
flow and speed in software projects.

DOAS is a web application built on top of the [DeliveryTracker](https://github.com/laetho/deliverytracker)
CRD (another experiment) and attempts to visualize the flow of 
commits on a component from HEAD to production.

We will attempt to visualize data to govern and coach product teams when
they might have lost their way. 

>The goal is to have the smallest delta between HEAD and what's 
 running in production.
